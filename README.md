# biofilm-morphogenesis
This project focus on studying how physical forces drives the morphogenesis of V. Cholerae biofilms. 
We wrote customized MATLAB codes to:
 - identify biofilm region;
 - calculate the periodicity of the pattern;
 - track the dynamics of pattern evolution; and 
 - calculate the local expansion velocity and curvature at the biofilm edge.
