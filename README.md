# biofilm-morphogenesis
This project focus on studying how physical forces drives the morphogenesis of V. Cholerae biofilms. 
We wrote customized MATLAB codes to:
 - identify biofilm region;
 - calculate the periodicity of the pattern;
 - track the dynamics of pattern evolution; and 
 - calculate the local expansion velocity and curvature at the biofilm edge.

 ### This code is associated with the paper from Yan et al., "Mechanical instability and interfacial energy drive biofilm morphogenesis". eLife, 2019. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43920
